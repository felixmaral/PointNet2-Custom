# PointNet++ (Custom Implementation)

This repository contains a **custom implementation** of **[PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413)**, originally proposed by **Charles R. Qi et al**: **[GitHub](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2)**.
The project is developed **for educational purposes and as a personal practice project** to explore PointNet++ for 3D point cloud segmentation/classification.

> **Status:** The **model is fully defined**. The project is **work in progress**.

## Current Status
- âœ… Model architecture implemented end-to-end
- ðŸ”§ Add dataloaders for multiple file types (e.g., `.ply`, `.bin`, `.npz`, etc.)
- ðŸ”§ Finalize `train.py` (training loop, logging, checkpoints, eval)
- ðŸ“š Complete documentation and usage examples

## Notes
- This code is intended for learning and experimentation; it is **not production-ready** yet.
- Interfaces and filenames may change during refactoring.
